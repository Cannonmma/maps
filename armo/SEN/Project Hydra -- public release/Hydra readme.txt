A comprehensive overhaul of the classic Blizzard campaigns, created by Pr0nogo.
Look for updates at http://www.staredit.net/topic/17560/

How to Play:
	-place the maps in your 1.21+ maps directory (usually `documents\starcraft\maps\`)
	-place HYDRA.exe anywhere you have read/write privileges, e.g. your desktop, or the maps directory
	-ensure you have patched to the latest version of SCBW using the Blizzard Battle.net App (XD)
	-run HYDRA.exe -- if you have problems launching, see the troubleshooting section
	-log into battle.net manually (button in the top-right, or press `L`)
	-connect to the desired battle.net gateway and play with your friends!

Troubleshooting:
	If your exe throws antivirus issues, it's showing false positives due to the plugin injection code. The exe is safe for your PC.
	
	If your exe does not run and shows an 'Unable to initialize game' error or a 'Launch injection error';
	-Navigate to your SCBW installation directory (usually `program files (x86)\starcraft\`)
	-Locate and delete `dbghelp.dll`
	
	If there is no file by that name, if you still run into issues, or if you run into a different issue, email me at Pronogo@hotmail.com
	or message me on teamliquid.net / staredit.net / discord.
